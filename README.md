# ESP32-BLE-Keyboardmouse
 
This was a short project to convert an old Zenith keyboard to bluetooth.

I used an esp32 dev board on perfboard to socket in where the keyboard once had an intel 8086 chip. All functionalty including indicator lights was obtained with no modifications to the board aside from removing the 8086.
